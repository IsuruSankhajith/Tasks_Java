You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer k.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most k transactions: i.e. you may buy at most k times and sell at most k times.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

 

Example 1:

Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
Example 2:

Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= 100
1 <= prices.length <= 1000
0 <= prices[i] <= 1000

        int n = prices.length;
        
        // If k is too large, it means you can make unlimited transactions.
        // In this case, you can use the approach of buying and selling whenever there's a profit.
        if (k >= n / 2) {
            int maxProfit = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
                if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                    maxProfit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
                }
            }
            return maxProfit;
        }
        
        // If k is not too large, use dynamic programming to find the maximum profit.
        int[][] dp = new int[k + 1][n];
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            int maxDiff = -prices[0];
            
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j - 1], prices[j] + maxDiff);
                maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, dp[i - 1][j] - prices[j]);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[k][n - 1];
    }
